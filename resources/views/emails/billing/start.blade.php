# Thank you for trying Voicebits 🙏!

Your trial is almost over. If you enjoyed using Voicebits, then we will ask you to subscribe to a plan that best suits you.

💳 <a href="{{ route('signup') }}">Subscribe to Voicebits</a>

If you are certain that Voicebits isn't right for you, <a href="{{ route('profile.show') }}">delete your account here</a> and you will never be billed or hear from us again. We just ask that you consider letting us know your reasons (we don't want to pitch you again, we just want to learn).

If you've got any questions about our plans, our company, or your trial, hit reply. Your email will be answered by me (Seriously, I read and answer every email).
