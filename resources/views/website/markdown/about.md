## The story

Voicebits was born out of a passion for podcasting and a frustration with the lack of affordable and reliable podcast hosting options. As an avid podcast enthusiast, I searched far and wide for a platform that would meet my needs, but came up short. That's when I realized there was a gap in the market that needed to be filled.

Driven by a vision to create a podcast hosting platform that would make podcasting accessible and hassle-free for podcasters of all levels, I embarked on a journey to create my own solution. With relentless determination and countless hours of hard work, Voicebits was launched on December 11, 2020.

Since then, our team has been committed to continuous improvement. We have listened attentively to feedback from our users and have made significant updates, including complete interface renewals and the implementation of multiple requested features. Our goal is to create a platform that not only meets, but exceeds the expectations of our valued podcasters.
