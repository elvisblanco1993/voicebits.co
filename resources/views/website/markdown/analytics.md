Podcast analytics can show you how many people are listening to your show, which apps are they using, and where in the world are they. Understanding this information can help you better understand your audience. Here we will talk about the best tools to get analytics for your podcasts.

### The best tools for getting podcast analytics:

#### 1. Your podcast hosting provider
If you are looking for an overview of listener trends, you may want to use a host that provides you with analytics on downloads from all listening apps. ([Voicebits](https://voicebits.co) offers this for all your shows at no extra cost)

#### 2. Apple Podcasts Connect

Apple offers additional tools that help you understand your subscribers/listeners using their app. Take a look at this by logging into your [Podcast Connect](https://podcastsconnect.apple.com) account.

#### 3. Chartable

Use Chartable if you want to track your podcasts' performance on all platforms. It offers a comprehensive analysis, breaking down metrics from major platforms like Spotify and Apple, as well as various other publishers distributing your shows. For a deeper insight into its offerings, explore [Chartable](https://chartable.com).

#### 4. Spotify

[Spotify](https://podcasters.spotify.com) gives you demographic information about your listeners, including information about their age, gender, and all your streams on the platform.

### Stats on your hosting platform

### Downloads per episode

If you want to have an idea of how many downloads an episode gets, Voicebits will show you the average episode downloads 7, 14, 30, and 60 days after it is released.

### Podcast subscribers

Honestly, there's no certain way of knowing hos may people subscribe to your podcast. The reason behind this is that there are many podcast players out there, and most of them don't share this information. Voicebits tries to estimate your subscriber count by using the amount of downloads your episodes get within 24 hours after publishing.

### Popular episodes

Voicebits allows you to filter your episodes by popularity (from most to least downloaded overall).
One factor we've noticed to increase downloads is big guests.
